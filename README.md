# CGP-Miniproject

repository for hand in assignment for CGP 
Inspiration taken from https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/flow/waves/

This project was made with unity build 2021.3.11f1

The mini project presents a surface shader in a form of a normal wave from the sea.

the shader contains a number of properties that can be manually tweaked, within the inspector of the material, or manipulated through the C# Code:

_Amplitude - Controls the height of each wave.

_wavelenght - Controls the width of the wave.

_Speed - Controls how fast the wave should be.
